## Risk Management

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Audit delays | Medium | High | Submit to SCF Audit Bank early (Tranche 1); engage backup auditor |
| Soroban protocol changes | Low | Medium | Pin SDK versions; CI tests against latest + pinned |
| Wallet SDK breaking changes | Low | Low | Abstract wallet layer; E2E tests catch regressions |
| Community adoption slow | Medium | Medium | GrantFox bounties; active social presence; documentation quality |

---

## Success Metrics

- **Technical:** 100% test pass rate, 0 critical/medium audit findings, <500ms API latency
- **Community:** 5+ contributors, 3+ funded GrantFox bounties, 100+ GitHub stars
- **Usage:** 1,000+ unique testnet wallets, 10,000+ faucet requests, 500+ contract interactions
- **Ecosystem:** Listed on Stellar Expert, Soroban dApp Store, and Stellar Developer Docs
